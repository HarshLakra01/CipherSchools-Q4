# Card Component Example with CSS

This project demonstrates how to create a simple card component using HTML and CSS. The `.card` class adds a border, padding, and a subtle shadow to make the content stand out.

## Features

- **Reusable `.card` CSS class**
  - Adds a light border
  - Provides internal padding
  - Applies a soft box-shadow for depth
  - Rounded corners for a modern look
- **Clean and centered layout**
- **Easy to customize for your own content**

## How to Use

1. **Download or copy** the `index.html` file from this repository.
2. **Open** `index.html` in any web browser.
3. **View** the card-styled `<div>` on the page.

## Customization

- Change border color, padding, or shadow by editing the `.card` class in the `<style>` section.
- Add your own content inside the `<div class="card">`.
- Adjust `max-width`, `border-radius`, or background color as needed.

## Example

<div class="card">
  This is a card! It has a border, padding, and a subtle shadow to give it a lifted appearance.
</div>
```
